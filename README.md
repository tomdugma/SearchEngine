# SearchEngine

The search engine allows the receipt of different queries, each query undergoes a thorough "scattering" so that when a user enters a query with a spelling error or any other error, the engine knows how to handle the query, and return relevant results to the user.

The results are ranked according to the weighting of several indices, such as BM25, Cossim similarity and more
